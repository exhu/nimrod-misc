Nimrod layout ideas:

Window(
    name = "main window",
    
    layout = FreeLayout {
        Button {
            text = "Close",
            action = "close window", -- requests function pointer associated 
                            -- with "close window" from current actions provider
            image = "close_btn"  -- requests resource named "close_btn" from 
                                -- current resource provider
        },
    }   
)

dockable windows:
    - modified input scenegraph
    - modified graphics scenegraph

Designed mainly for OpenGL, so all coordinates are floats,
only one top window etc.

Window:
    name: "main"
    layout: HBox
    contents:
        - Button
            text: "Close"
            action: "close window"
            image: "close_btn"
            
        - Button
            text: "Next"
            action: "next"
            image: "next_btn"
            
        - Group
            layout: VBox
            contents:
                - Checkbox

UINode:
    - parent
    - get_prefered_size
    - size
    - position
    
UIContainer -> UINode:
    - layout
    - contents (contained nodes)

Controls graph uses graphics and input graphs.
