Nimrod layout ideas:

Window(
    name = "main window",
    
    layout = FreeLayout {
        Button {
            text = "Close",
            action = "close window", -- requests function pointer associated 
                            -- with "close window" from current actions provider
            image = "close_btn"  -- requests resource named "close_btn" from 
                                -- current resource provider
        },
    }
